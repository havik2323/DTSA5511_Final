# Intel Image Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains the files and code for an image classification task focused on categorizing images of different scenes. The project uses the Intel Image Classification dataset, which includes images from various categories such as buildings, seas, mountains, glaciers, forests, and streets.

The classification model was trained using deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these different classes.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Model Inference**: Use the trained model found in the `best_model/` folder to classify the sample images from the `sample_input/` folder.
2. **Notebook**: The `DTSA5511_Final_Project.ipynb` contains all the code used for model training, evaluation, and inference.
3. **Presentations**: The `DTSA5511 - Intel Image Classification.pptx` and `DTSA_5511_Presentation_Video.mp4` provide a summary and explanation of the project results, techniques, and findings.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Intel Image Classification dataset, which consists of 6 different categories of images: 
- Buildings
- Seas
- Mountains
- Glaciers
- Forests
- Streets

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning Framework (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy in classifying the images into the correct categories. Please refer to the notebook and the presentation for details on the results, including accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and more.

## Usage
To replicate the results, ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. You can run the notebook in your environment, and utilize the trained model provided in the `best_model/` directory.
